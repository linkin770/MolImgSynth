# MolImgSynth

Welcome to **MolImgSynth**, a simple yet useful generator capable of producing molecular images in various styles.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.8.7**

- Other dependencies only need to support Python 3.8.7

- Unzip background images to backgrounds:
  `backgrounds.zip`


## Project Use
This project is used in our paper **"LIMIR: Lightweight Molecular Image Recognizer based on multi-scale feature fusion encoder and attention-residual decoder"** for data synthesis.

## Future Work
Additionally, we have designed a more feature-rich molecular image generator, also used in the paper. However, the code has some issues causing the generated images to be distorted, which we are currently fixing.
